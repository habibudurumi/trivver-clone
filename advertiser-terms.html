        legal counsel of its choice. You may not enter into any agreement, which would in any manner, affect the right
        of Trivver, constitute an admission of fault or liability by Trivver, or bind Trivver in any manner, without the
        prior written consent of Trivver. In the event Trivver decides to assume control of the defense of such claim,
        Trivver shall not settle any such claim requiring payment from you without your prior written approval.</p>
      <h2>CHOICE OF LAW AND VENUE</h2>
      <p>Any claim and/or dispute that arises from your use of the Advertiser Account, Trivver Asset Editor and Content
        shall be decided in accordance with the laws of the State of California. Subject to the arbitration provision
        below, you agree that any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) shall be
        brought in the state or federal courts located in Orange County, California, United States of America. You agree
        that such courts shall have personal jurisdiction over you and agree to submit to the jurisdiction and venue of
        such courts, and waive any objections based on inconvenient forum.</p>
      <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
      <p>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, of the breach, termination,
        enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof shall be determined by arbitration in Orange County, California
        before a single arbitrator. <strong>ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
          CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS
          ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO
          PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST TRIVVER.</strong> The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant
        to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. You and Trivver hereby expressly waive trial by jury. The
        arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
        jurisdiction. If applicable, consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family,
        or household use) may elect to pursue their claim in their local small-claims court rather than through
        arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims courts and proceeds only on an individual (non-class
        or non-representative) basis.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand and agree that any use or dissemination of Trivver’s Confidential
        Information in violation of this Agreement will cause Trivver irreparable harm, and that monetary damages will
        not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, and that Trivver will
        have no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, Trivver shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or
        remedies, to such injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction
        without requirement for bond. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for any breach of
        this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.</p>
      <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      <p>This Agreement, and any and all rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by
        you, and any attempted transfer or assignment, whether in full or in part, will be null and void.</p>
      <h2>ABILITY TO ACCEPT TERMS OF SERVICE</h2>
      <p>You affirm that you are more than the legal age in the territory in which you reside and are fully able and
        competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set
        forth in the Agreement, and to abide by and comply with the Agreement.</p>
      <h2>NO WAIVER</h2>
      <p>Trivver’s failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not be
        construed as a waiver of any provision or right.</p>
      <h2>SEVERABILITY</h2>
      <p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, then it will be changed
        and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the maximum extent possible under applicable
        law, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
      <h2>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
      <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior negotiations, understandings, or
        agreements (whether oral or written) between the parties about the subject matter of this Agreement.</p>
      <h2>MODIFICATION OF AGREEMENT</h2>
      <p>We may amend this Agreement at any time with notice that we deem to be reasonable by posting the revised
        version on our website or communicating it to you through your Trivver account. The updated agreement will be
        effective as of the time it is posted. Your continued use of and access to the Advertiser Account, Trivver Asset
        Editor, and/or Content after the posting of an updated agreement constitutes your acceptance of such updated
        agreement.</p>
      <h2>THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES</h2>
      <p>Except as otherwise expressly stated in the terms of this Agreement, there are no third-party beneficiaries.
      </p>
