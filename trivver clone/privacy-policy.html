      <p>This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is intended to assist you in understanding how Trivver, Inc. (“Trivver,
        “we”, “our”, or “us”) collect, use, and protect any information when a person or business (“you,” “your”)
        applies or signs-up for an account through our website, mobile application, and/or other platform (the
        “Platforms”) and whenever you access or use in any manner any Trivver application, software, product, service,
        feature, technology, content, or website (collectively, “Services”). Your use of any of the Platforms and/or
        Services signifies your consent to be legally bound by both this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Service, and any
        other applicable Trivver agreement. If you do not agree to either the Privacy Policy or the Terms of Service,
        please refrain from using the Platforms and Services. Trivver is committed to complying with all applicable laws
        and regulations governing the content of the Platforms and Services (as defined below) provided by Trivver.</p>
      <h2>PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. The revised version will be effective at the time we post it. We
        will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any substantial changes in how we use your information,
        including by e-mail at the e-mail address you provide to us. You may cancel your account at any time. We
        encourage you to review this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of
        any amendment to this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h2>NOTICE TO MINORS</h2>
      <p>Trivver aims to fully comply with all federal laws and, thus, at a minimum, you must be at least thirteen (13)
        years of age to use the Platforms and/or Services. No one under thirteen (13) years of age may provide any
        personal information. Trivver does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of
        thirteen (13).</p>
      <p>If you are under thirteen (13) years of age, please do not send any information about yourself to us, or to
        anyone else through the Platforms. Personal information includes, but is not limited to, your name, address,
        telephone number, and/or e-mail address. If we learn we have collected any personal information from anyone
        under the age of thirteen (13), we will immediately delete that information per the requirements of the
        Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and any other applicable laws. If you believe we have received
        information from or about a child under the age of thirteen (13), please contact us at support@trivver.com with
        a subject heading &quot;Privacy Policy&quot;.</p>
      <h2>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>In order to use certain features of the Platforms, you will need to provide several types of personally
        identifiable information (the “Identification Information”) when you apply or sign up for a Trivver account and
        when you provide information as part of our identity or account verification process.</p>
      <p>Identification Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, address, Social Security, e-mail
        address, telephone number, photograph, birthdate, passport, Taxpayer Identification, or other government-issued
        identification number.</p>
      <p>We also collect financial information, including bank account and payment card numbers for purposes of sending
        and receiving payments in connection with the Services, which is handled by our third party payment processing
        company, as well as tax information (as applicable), and other historical, contact, product preferences, product
        and services you sell (including without limitation inventory, pricing, and other data), activities, and
        demographic information.</p>
      <p>You may choose not to provide any Identification Information that we request from time to time; however, we ask
        for the Identification Information that is necessary to complete the activity you are requesting to partake in.
        Thus, if you choose not to provide the requested Identification Information, you may not be able to participate
        in the activity or enjoy the full functionality of the Platforms or Services.</p>
      <p>We may also collect certain usage information as a result of your use of the Platforms and/or Services (the
        “Usage Information”). Usage Information includes certain standard web measurement and tracking technologies,
        such as “cookies,” web server logs, or other statistical programs to collect, track, and record how you use the
        Platforms and Services; information about the location of your device; specific information about your device
        when you access our Services, including hardware model, operating system/version, unique device identifier,
        mobile network information, and information about the device’s interaction with our Services; information about
        how you use our Services, including your access time, browser type and language, and Internet Protocol (“IP”)
        address; information about when and where the transactions occur, the names of the transacting parties, a
        description of the transactions, the payment or transfer amounts, billing and shipping information, and the
        devices and payment methods used to complete the transactions, including in conjunction with our third party
        payment processor; and technologies to collect information when using our Services, including sending cookies to
        your device and using web beacons to deliver cookies, track the number of visits to the Platforms and/or use of
        the Services, customization of our Platforms and/or Services, collect statistical information, and understand
        usage and campaign effectiveness (cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive or in your
        device memory when you visit a website or view a message, and web beacons are electronic images that may be used
        in our Services or e-mails).</p>
      <p>In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this
        type of information in order to increase our Service’s functionality. These third party service providers have
        their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information. To opt-out of Google Analytics tracking for
        all sites in Chrome, you can install <a
          href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-analytics-opt-out/fllaojicojecljbmefodhfapmkghcbnh?hl=en"
          target="_blank">the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on</a>
      </p>
      <p>Usage Information helps us measure the success of the Platforms, Services, and its features or pages in order
        to improve your experience. Your browser may have the option which allows you to accept cookies, reject cookies,
        or receive a notification when a cookie is sent, but you should note that the use of such restrictive browser
        settings may limit your use of the Platforms or Services. Trivver does not use spyware, adware, or any similarly
        intrusive software.</p>
      <h2>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING</h2>
      <p>We may use third-party service providers to deliver content and/or third-party advertising companies and/or
        media partners in connection with our Platforms and/or Services and to provide site metrics and other analytics
        services. These third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information, such
        as your IP address, identifiers associated with your device, other applications on your device, the browsers you
        use to access our Services, webpages viewed, time spent on webpages, links clicked, and transaction information.
        This information may be used by Trivver and third-party service providers on behalf of Trivver to analyze and
        track usage of our Services, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content
        targeted to your interests, and better understand how you use our Services. Additionally, we may use web beacons
        provided by third-party advertising companies to help manage our online advertising. These web beacons enable us
        to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the Platforms to learn which advertisements bring users to
        our Platforms. To learn more about third-party advertising companies, cookies, and how to opt-out of this
        advertising, please visit <a href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp"
          target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, third-party cookies, web beacons, or
        other tracking technologies, which are covered by such third parties’ privacy policies. For more information, we
        encourage you to check the privacy policies of these third parties to learn about their privacy practices. For
        more information about targeted advertising specifically, please visit <a

      <h2>USE OF INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>Trivver uses your information for the following business purposes: to provide the Services; to respond to
        inquiries we receive from you or in connection with a transaction you initiate; to analyze, manage, and improve
        the Platforms or Services; to use it within Trivver for the purpose of developing and improving our Services for
        you; to notify you of special offers, programs, news, or alerts that we believe may be of interest to you; to

        specific transaction that you request and we do not condition your participation in any specific activity on our
        Platforms or Services on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to complete that
        activity. Information such as traffic patterns and the number of page visits help us to further develop and
        improve the Platforms and Services to better meet your needs. You expressly authorize us to share your
        information with certain third parties to the extent necessary to perform any of the business purposes included
        within this Privacy Policy or disclosed to you at the time of disclosure of your information. Please note that
        in connection with certain requests, you may be transferred to a different web site and/or application, which
        will have a different privacy policy. If you do not want to be contacted for these purposes or if you would like
        to obtain a copy of your information we gathered, or correct or delete such information from our database, you
        may e-mail us with your concern or question. If you voluntarily disclose any Identification Information or
        personally identifiable information in a community forum, such information may be collected and used by others
        and may result in unsolicited messages from other parties. We have no control over this type of use of your
        Identification Information or personally identifiable information and cannot be held responsible.</p>
      <h2>SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>We may disclose the information we collect from and about you when we have reason to believe that such
        disclosure is necessary to: with our affiliate companies; with third parties to provide, maintain, and improve
        our Services, including service providers who access information about you to perform services on our behalf as
        well as financial institutions, payment networks, and other entities in connection with the payment or money
        transfer process; with third parties for advertising campaigns, contest, special offers and promotions, or other
        events or activities in connection with our Platforms and/or Services; with other users of our Platforms and/or
        Services with whom you interact through your own use of our Platforms and/or Services; identify, contract, or
        bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property,
        customers, or other users of the Platforms or Services, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities;
        enforce the Terms of Service; take precautions against liability, investigate and defend against any third-party

        purposes; permit us to process any of your requests; or otherwise with your consent.</p>
      <p>Trivver may transfer your Identification Information in the event of a sale, merger, acquisition, or any other
        change in control, including rights acquired or transferred to third parties through a bankruptcy, insolvency,
        reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors.</p>
      <p>Under the laws of some jurisdictions, you may be entitled to request disclosure regarding how we share your
        Usage Information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. To the extent required by applicable law, we
        shall provide the information to you upon your written request to Trivver. Except for the reasons we have made
        you aware of, or make you aware of from time to time, or otherwise with your consent, we will not share your
        Identification Information with any third party.</p>
      <h2>LINKED SITES</h2>
      <p>Our Platforms may contain links to other websites, including social media pages, which may have different
        privacy policies. We are not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of collected information through
        third-party websites and expressly disclaim any liability related to such collection, use, or disclosure. We are
        not responsible for any information or content contained on such sites. Links to other websites are provided for
        convenience only. Please note that if you provide information to us via a social media page or participate in a
        social media page linked to the Platforms, you consent to our use of your information for any reason as if it
        were submitted to us directly through the Platforms.</p>
      <h2>OPTING-IN AND OPTING-OUT</h2>
      <p>Trivver will endeavor to ask you to agree to receive communications about special offers, programs, news, or
        alerts from Trivver and/or any of our affiliate brands or partners at the time you provide your e-mail address
        to us (an “Opt-In”). In the event that you provide your e-mail address via a channel that does not include a
        mechanism for you to affirmatively Opt-In, such as by e-mail, you agree that by providing your e-mail address,
        you are completing an Opt-In and will be responsible for opting-out from receiving any future communications
        about special offers, programs, news, or alerts. You can do this by following the instructions provided in each
        communication (an “Opt-Out”).</p>
      <h2>UPDATING OR CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT</h2>
      <p>You may access, change, or correct your Identification Information about you by logging into your Trivver
        account at any time or by making a request to us using the contact details below, in which case we may need to
        verify your identity before granting access or otherwise changing or correcting your information. If you wish to
        deactivate your Trivver account, you may do so by logging into your Trivver account or by e-mailing us using the
        contact details provided below. Trivver may retain information about you only as long as reasonably necessary to
        provide you the Services. However, even after you deactivate your Trivver account, we may retain archived copies
        of information about you and any transactions or Services in which you may have participated for a period of
        time that is consistent with applicable law, or as we believe is reasonably necessary to comply with applicable
        law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, to prevent fraud, to collect fees owed, to resolve
        disputes, to address problems with our Services, to assist with investigations, to enforce our Terms of Service,
        or other applicable agreements or policies, or to take any other actions consistent with applicable law.</p>
      <h2>DO NOT TRACK</h2>
      <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is an optional browser setting that allows you to express your preferences regarding
        tracking across websites. We currently do not respond to DNT signals. We may continue to collect information in
        the manner described in this Privacy Policy from web browsers that have enabled DNT signals or similar
        mechanisms.</p>
      <h2>MOBILE APPLICATIONS</h2>
      <p>From time to time, we may offer mobile applications for public consumption and/or download (the “Apps”). We
        will use commercially reasonable efforts, given the limitations imposed upon us by third party providers such as
        Apple, Inc. and Google, Inc. to clearly disclose what, if any Identification Information or Usage Information is
        collected by the Apps, how it is used, and with who it is shared. In the event that it is not commercially
        feasible for us to provide this explanation in advance of you accessing and using the Apps, this Privacy Policy
        shall govern any information collected by us as a result of your use of the Apps.</p>
      <p>Please note, certain practices are outside of Trivver’s control, including any tracking by Apple, Inc. and
        Google, Inc. or your third party telecommunications carrier of which Apps you download. We cannot and will not
        be held responsible for the actions of such third parties. You should always read and understand the policies of
        any third party provider before making any purchase or downloading any of the Apps.</p>
      <h2>TEXT MESSAGING</h2>
      <p>From time to time, we may run certain campaigns that provide you with the ability to send a text message and
        provide an Opt-In to receive future text messages. Your Opt-In provides us with your mobile phone number. If you
        choose to Opt-In, you agree that we may send messages to the mobile device about new products, promotions,
        services, or offers. Your carrier may charge you for each message you receive in accordance with your
        communications plan. You agree that we are not responsible in any way for such charges. If you do not wish to
        continue receiving any messages via your mobile device, you may Opt-Out at any time.</p>
      <h2>SECURITY PROCEDURES</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, to protect your
        information from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We hold
        information about you at our own premises and with the assistance of third-party service providers.</p>
      <p>However, your e-mail transmissions and/or other communications containing Identification Information may be
        unlawfully intercepted and/or accessed by third parties and/or the Platforms may be subject to hostile network
        attacks or administrative errors. We urge you to take every precaution and exercise care to protect your
        personal data and the information you share when you are on the internet and/or using the Platforms. Change your
        passwords often, use a combination of letters (upper and lower case), numbers, special characters, and make sure
        you use a secure browser. We cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information transmitted over the
        Internet, or other electronic means. We take steps that we believe are commercially reasonable to limit access
        to your Identification Information to only those whom we determine need access to provide requested products,
        services, offers, or opportunities that may be of interest to you. We cannot guarantee that your Identification
        Information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed as a result of a breach of our commercially
        reasonable efforts or as a result of any event beyond our reasonable control. Accordingly, we do not guarantee
        that your Identification Information is completely secure and safe from such risks. We expressly disclaim any
        representation or warranty, express or implied, with respect to ensuring, guaranteeing, or otherwise offering a
        definitive promise of security in connection with your Identification Information or Usage Information.</p>
      <h2>INTERNATIONAL USERS</h2>
      <p>The Platforms are hosted in the United States. If you are attempting to access the Platforms from a physical
        location within the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing data
        collection, use, and disclosure that differ from the United States, please be advised that your use of the
        Platforms is governed by United States law, this Privacy Policy, the Terms of Use, and any other applicable
        agreement. To the extent you provide Identification Information through the Platforms you are transferring your
        Identification Information to the United States and you consent to: such transfer; the application of the laws
        of the United States and the State of California with respect to any dispute arising from or related to the
        Privacy Policy and/or your use of the Platforms; exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
        California. </p>
      <h2>CHOICE OF LAW AND VENUE</h2>
      <p>Any claim and/or dispute that arises from your use of the Platforms shall be decided in accordance with the
        laws of the State of California, by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Orange County, California,
        United States of America. You agree that such court shall have personal jurisdiction over you and agree to
        submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts, and waive any objections based on inconvenient forum.</p>
      <h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
      <p>If any part of this Privacy Policy is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law,
        then it shall be construed in a manner which is valid and enforceable that is closest to the intentions set
        forth herein. The remainder of the Privacy Policy shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting our Platforms.</p>
