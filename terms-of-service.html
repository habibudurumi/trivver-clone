        their permission.</p>
      <p>You agree that you shall immediately notify Trivver of any unauthorized use of your username, password, or any
        other breach of security whatsoever. In order to safeguard your security, the security of the Platforms, and the
        user experience of others, you agree to log out of your account at the end of each session on the Platforms.
        Please remember to exercise particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so
        others are not able to view or record your password or other personal information.</p>
      <p>As you browse the Platforms, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information. It
        is a condition of your use of the Platforms that all the information you provide on the Platforms is correct,
        current, and complete.</p>
      <p>We reserve the right to disable any user identification code, username, or password, whether chosen by you or
        provided by us, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including if, in our opinion, you have
        failed to comply with any provision of the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, or any other applicable agreement, law,
        or regulation.</p>
      <h2>LICENSE GRANT TO TRIVVER</h2>
