      <p>These Publisher Terms of Service (“Agreement”) are a legal agreement between you (either an individual or any
        entity, referred to herein as “you,” “your,” or “Publisher”) and Trivver, Inc. (“Trivver,” “we,” “our,” or “us”)
        governing your use of Trivver’s software development kit files, tools, programs, and utilities, as well as any

        and/or other platforms (the “Platforms”). Please read this entire Agreement carefully, including without
        limitation, any linked terms and conditions, privacy policies, or other policies appearing or referenced below,
        which are hereby made part of this Agreement. To access the Publisher Tools, you must accept all of the terms of
        this Agreement. If you are an individual representing an entity, you acknowledge that you have the requisite
        authority to accept this Agreement on behalf of such entity.</p>

        Policy, which discloses the type of information collected, how such information is used, and the steps taken to
        secure such information <a href="privacy-policy.html">the Privacy Policy here</a>.</p>
      <h2>LICENSE GRANT TO PUBLISHER</h2>
      <p>Subject to the terms and conditions in this Agreement (as a condition to the grant below), Trivver hereby

          deceptive, fraudulent or other invalid means, including but not limited to through repeated manual clicks, the
          use of robots or other automated query tools and/or computer generated requests, and/or the unauthorized use
          of other optimization services and/or software; and</li>
        <li>Not use the Publisher Tools or Content for any illegal, unauthorized, or other improper purpose.</li>
      </ol>

        discretion.</p>
      <h2>CONTENT SUBMISSIONS</h2>
      <p>Publisher Tools may allow for the submission of content, including by Trivver’s advertisers, and except as
        expressly provided in these terms, Trivver does not acquire any ownership of any intellectual property rights
        that you or the advertisers hold in the content that you submit using the Publisher Tools. By submitting,
        posting or displaying content to or from the Publisher Tools through your Service, you give Trivver a perpetual,
        irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish,
        publicly perform, publicly display, and distribute such content. However, Trivver will only use such content for
        the purpose of enabling Trivver to provide its services, the Publisher Tools, and only in accordance with the
        applicable Trivver privacy policies. Before you submit content via Publisher Tools and your Service, you must
        ensure that you have the necessary rights, authorizations, and permission, including any necessary rights,
        authorizations, and permissions from any and all applicable third parties, to grant us the license.</p>
      <h2>PAYMENT TERMS</h2>
      <p>To benefit from use of the Publisher Tools, you must submit a credit or debit card (Visa, Mastercard, American
        Express, Discover, JCB, and Diners Club credit and debit cards) and/or bank account information (a “Payment
        Instrument”) through which you may receive amounts through our designated third-party online payment processor
        (currently, Stripe) in connection with any advertisements from Trivver and/or its Advertisers published through
        your Service. You authorize Trivver or our third-party online payment processor to store the Payment Instrument,
        along with other related transaction information, and bill (if applicable) and/or use the designated Payment
        Instrument as provided for herein. Our third-party online payment processor may hold amounts for up to 90 days
        as part of their delayed payments option.</p>
      <h2>UPDATES</h2>
      <p>You acknowledge that Trivver may modify or update the Publisher Tools from time to time, and at its sole
        discretion (each modification, an “Update”). You are required to implement and use the most current version of
        the Publisher Tools and to update your Services, as may be required as a result of the Update, at your sole cost
        and expense. Be aware that an Update may adversely affect the manner in which your Services access or
        communicate with the Publisher Tools or Content. By continuing access or use of the Publisher Tools following an
        Update will constitute binding acceptance of the Update.</p>
      <h2>USE OF TRIVVER’S MARKS</h2>
      <p>Trivver’s name, or logos that Trivver makes available to you, including via the Publisher Tools, Content,
        and/or Platforms (the “Trivver Marks”) may not be included in or as part of your registered corporate name, any
        of your logos, or any of your service or product names. You may not create any derivative works of the Trivver
        Marks or use the Trivver Marks in a manner that creates or reasonably implies an inaccurate relationship,
        endorsement, sponsorship or association with Trivver. All use of the Trivver Marks, and all goodwill arising out
        of such use, will inure to Trivver’s sole benefit. You will not use the Trivver Marks expect as expressly
        authorized herein without Trivver’s written consent, and you will not remove, alter, or modify any proprietary
        notices or Trivver Marks on the Publisher Tools, Content, or Platforms. Additionally, you will not use any
        business names, trademarks, service marks, or logos in a manner that can mislead, confuse, or deceive users of
        your Services.</p>
      <h2>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS; OWNERSHIP</h2>
      <p>The Publisher Tools and Content are licensed, not sold, and Trivver retains and reserves all rights not
        expressly granted in this Agreement. You agree that Trivver and/or third parties own all legal right, title and
        interest in and to the Publisher Tools and Content, including any Intellectual Property Rights (or IP Rights)
        that subsist in the Publisher Tools and Content. “Intellectual Property Rights” of “IP Rights” mean any and all
        rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary
        rights as well as all rights in know-how, data (including all applications therefor), and all proprietary rights
        under the laws of the United States, any other jurisdictions, or any treaty.</p>
      <p>You agree not to do anything inconsistent with such ownership, including without limitation, challenging
        Trivver’s ownership of the IP Rights and Trivver Marks, challenging the validity of the license granted herein,
        or otherwise copying or exploiting the Trivver Marks during or after the termination of this Agreement, except
        as specifically authorized herein. If you acquire any rights in the Trivver Marks or any confusingly similar
        marks, by operation of law or otherwise, you will, at no expense to Trivver, immediately assign in full such
        rights to Trivver.</p>
      <h2>FEEDBACK</h2>
      <p>From time to time, Trivver may solicit from you, or you may provide, in your sole discretion, suggestions for
        changes, modifications, improvements, or any other feedback related to any Publisher Tools, Content, or Trivver
        (collectively, “Publisher Feedback”). All Publisher Feedback shall be solely owned by Trivver, including all
        intellectual property rights therein, and shall also be deemed Trivver’s Confidential Information. You hereby
        assign all right, title, and interest in and to any Publisher Feedback to Trivver, and acknowledge and agree
        that Trivver has the unrestricted right to use and exploit such Publisher Feedback in any manner, without
        attribution, and without any obligations or compensation to Publisher.</p>
      <h2>CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>
      <p>You may be given access to certain non-public information, software, and specifications relating to the
        Publisher Tools and Content (“Confidential Information”), which is confidential and proprietary to Trivver. You
        may use this Confidential Information only as necessary in exercising your rights granted by this Agreement. You
        may not disclose any of this Confidential Information to any third party without Trivver’s prior written
        consent. You agree that you will protect this Confidential Information from unauthorized use, access, or
        disclosure in the same manner that you would use to protect your own confidential and proprietary information of
        a similar nature, and in no event with no less than a reasonable degree of care.</p>
      <h2>TERMINATION</h2>
      <p>Trivver may terminate this Agreement for any reason or for no reason at any time. We may also suspend your
        access to the Publisher Tools if you have violated the terms of this Agreement, or any other agreement you have
        with Trivver, or Trivver’s policies, or provide any false, incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading information, or
        otherwise engage in fraudulent or illegal content. If your Trivver account is terminated or suspended for any
        reason or no reason, you agree (i) to continue to be bound by this Agreement; (ii) that all licenses granted
        herein immediately expire, (iii) to immediately stop using the Publisher Tools, Content, and Platforms; and
        (iii) that Trivver will not be liable to you or any third party for termination or suspension of access to the
        Publisher Tools, Content and/or Platforms, including without limitation, any and all liability for compensation,
        reimbursement, or damages in connection with your use of the Publisher Tools, Content, or Platforms. You may
        terminate this Agreement, and other Trivver agreements, by closing your Trivver account at any time (except as
        may be provided for in your other Trivver agreements) and/or ceasing your access to the Publisher Tools and use
        of all Trivver Content.</p>
      <h2>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY</h2>
      <p>PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT, AND PLATFORMS ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. USE OF THE
        PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT, AND PLATFORMS IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,

        INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
        NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM TRIVVER, OR THROUGH
        ANY PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT, OR PLATFORMS WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. WITHOUT
        LIMITATION THE FOREGOING, TRIVVER, ITS PROCESSORS, ITS PROVIDERS, ITS LICENSORS (AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
        SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENT, DIRETORS, AND EMPLOYEES) DO NOT WARRANT THAT PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT, AND
        PLATFORMS ARE ACCURATE, RELIABLE OR CORRECT; THAT PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT, OR PLATFORMS WILL MEET YOUR
        REQUIREMENTS; THAT PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT, OR PLATFORMS WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION,
        UNINTERRUPED OR SECURE; THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT, OR
        PLATFORMS ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ANY CONTENT OR DATA DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED
        THROUGH THE USE OF THE PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT, AND/OR PLATFORMS ARE DOWNLOADED AT YOUR OWN RISK AND YOU WILL
        BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM SUCH DOWNLOAD.</p>
      <h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
      <p>IN NO EVENT SHALL TRIVVER, ITS PROCESSORS, ITS SUPPLIERS, OR ITS LICENSORS, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES,
        AGENTS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES, BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
        CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE,
        DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, INABILITY TO USE, OR UNAVAILABILITY OF THE
        PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT, OR PLATFORMS. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL TRIVVER BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS,
        OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING, OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT,
        PLATFORMS OR YOUR TRIVVER ACCOUNT, OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
        APPLICABLE LAW, TRIVVER, ITS PROCESSORS, ITS SUPPLIERS, AND ITS LICENSORS (AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES,
        AGENTS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES) ASSUME NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR
        INACCURACIES OF PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT, OR PLATFORMS; (II) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE
        WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT, OR PLATFORMS; (III) ANY
        UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SECURE SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN; (IV)
        ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT, OR PLATFORMS; (V) ANY BUGS,
        VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT, OR PLATOFRMS
        BY ANY THIRD PARTY; (VI) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY DATA OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF
        THE USE OF ANY DATA POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH PUBLISHER TOOLS, CONTENT,
        OR PLATFORMS IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED USD
        $100.</p>
      <p>THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT,
        NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF TRIVVER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW IN THE
        APPLICABLE JURISDICTION. TO THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ANY LIMITATION ON LIABILITY HEREIN, THE
        PARTIES AGREE THAT SUCH LIMITATION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY MODIFIED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT SO AS TO MAKE THE
        LIMITATION COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
      <h2>INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
      <p>You agree to indemnify and defend Trivver, including our respective employees, directors, agents, affiliates,
        and representatives, from and again any and all actions, demands, claims, and suits, losses, damages, judgments,
        tax assessments (including without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) instituted by a person or entity
        arising out of: (i) your actual or alleged breach of your representations, warranties, or obligations under this
        Agreement; (ii) your wrongful or unpermitted use of the Publisher Tools, Content, or Platforms; (iii) the
        performance, promotion, sale, or distribution of your Services; (iv) your violation of any third-party right,
        including without limitation any right of privacy, publicity rights, or Intellectual Property Rights; or (v)
        your violation of any law, rule, or regulation of the United State or any other jurisdiction. Trivver reserves
        the right, at its option and sole discretion, to assume full control of the defense of claims with legal counsel
        of its choice. You may not enter into any agreement, which would in any manner, affect the right of Trivver,
        constitute an admission of fault or liability by Trivver, or bind Trivver in any manner, without the prior
        written consent of Trivver. In the event Trivver decides to assume control of the defense of such claim, Trivver
        shall not settle any such claim requiring payment from you without your prior written approval.</p>
      <h2>CHOICE OF LAW AND VENUE</h2>
      <p>Any claim and/or dispute that arises from your use of the Publisher Tools and Content shall be decided in
        accordance with the laws of the State of California. Subject to the arbitration provision below, you agree that
        any judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions in consumer cases) shall be brought in the state or
        federal courts located in Orange County, California, United States of America. You agree that such courts shall
        have personal jurisdiction over you and agree to submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts, and waive
        any objections based on inconvenient forum.</p>
      <h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
      <p>Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement, of the breach, termination,
        enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof shall be determined by arbitration in Orange County, California
        before a single arbitrator. <strong>ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.
          CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS
          ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO
          PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST TRIVVER.</strong> The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant
        to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures. You and Trivver hereby expressly waive trial by jury. The
        arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent
        jurisdiction. If applicable, consumer claimants (individuals whose transaction is intended for personal, family,
        or household use) may elect to pursue their claim in their local small-claims court rather than through
        arbitration so long as their matter remains in small claims courts and proceeds only on an individual (non-class
        or non-representative) basis.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, you understand and agree that any use or dissemination of Trivver’s Confidential
        Information in violation of this Agreement will cause Trivver irreparable harm, and that monetary damages will
        not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information, and that Trivver will
        have no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, Trivver shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or
        remedies, to such injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction
        without requirement for bond. Such remedies shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for any breach of
        this Agreement but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity.</p>
